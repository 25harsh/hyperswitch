# Product Context: Hyperswitch Codebase Analysis

**1. Why This Project Exists:**

This internal project aims to deeply understand the Hyperswitch codebase, specifically the modules within the `crates/` directory. The primary goal is to generate a "rulebook" that documents observed coding patterns, architectural decisions, and conventions.

**2. Problems It Solves:**

*   **Knowledge Siloing:** Reduces reliance on individual developers' knowledge by creating a shared understanding of the codebase.
*   **Onboarding Friction:** Helps new developers (and AI assistants like Cline) get up to speed faster.
*   **Inconsistent Development:** By documenting existing patterns, it encourages more consistent coding practices.
*   **Difficulty in Refactoring/Maintenance:** A clear understanding of the current state makes future changes safer and more efficient.

**3. How It Should Work (The Analysis Process):**

*   **Iterative Exploration:** Systematically examine files and directories within `crates/`.
*   **Pattern Identification:** Look for recurring structures, naming conventions, error handling, module organization, etc.
*   **Documentation:** Record findings in `rulebook.md` and update other Memory Bank files as needed.
*   **Continuous Refinement:** The rulebook and understanding will evolve as more of the codebase is explored.

**4. User Experience Goals (For Cline & Developers using the Rulebook):**

*   **Clarity:** The rulebook should be easy to understand and navigate.
*   **Accuracy:** Documented patterns should accurately reflect the codebase.
*   **Actionability:** The insights should be practical and help in understanding or modifying the code.
*   **Discoverability:** Key patterns and conventions should be easily findable.
