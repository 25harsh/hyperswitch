# Tech Context: Hyperswitch Codebase Analysis

**1. Technologies Used:**

*   **Primary Language:** Rust. The analysis will focus on Rust-specific idioms, patterns, and best practices.
*   **Build System:** Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system). Understanding `Cargo.toml` files within crates will be important.
*   **Key Crates (Anticipated):** Standard library, `tokio` (for asynchronous operations), `serde` (for serialization/deserialization), `actix` (if used for web framework), database ORM/query builders (e.g., `diesel`, `sqlx`), logging frameworks (e.g., `log`, `tracing`). This list will be refined as analysis progresses.
*   **Version Control:** Git (implied by the project structure).

**2. Development Setup (Assumed for Hyperswitch):**

*   Standard Rust development environment (rustc, cargo).
*   Likely uses a specific Rust toolchain version (defined in `rust-toolchain.toml` or similar).
*   Linters/Formatters: `rustfmt` for code formatting, `clippy` for linting (implied by `.rustfmt.toml` and `.clippy.toml`).

**3. Technical Constraints:**

*   **Performance:** As a payment switch, performance and low latency are likely critical. This might influence design choices (e.g., async, efficient data structures).
*   **Reliability & Correctness:** Financial transactions demand high reliability and correctness. Error handling, testing, and type safety will be key areas of focus.
*   **Security:** Handling sensitive payment data means security is paramount. Code related to data handling, encryption, and authentication will be scrutinized.
*   **Maintainability & Scalability:** The codebase needs to be maintainable and scalable to accommodate new features, connectors, and increasing transaction volumes.

**4. Dependencies:**

*   The project is composed of multiple local crates (within the `crates/` directory). Understanding their interdependencies is crucial.
*   External dependencies will be listed in `Cargo.toml` files for each crate.

**5. Tool Usage Patterns (For this Analysis Task):**

*   **File System Navigation:** `list_files` to explore directory structures.
*   **Code Reading:** `read_file` to examine individual source files.
*   **Definition Listing:** `list_code_definition_names` to get an overview of structures within modules.
*   **Pattern Searching:** `search_files` with regex to find specific code constructs or patterns across multiple files.
*   **Documentation:** `write_to_file` and `replace_in_file` to create and update the `rulebook.md` and other memory bank files.
