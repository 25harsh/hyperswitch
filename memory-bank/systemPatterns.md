# System Patterns: Hyperswitch Codebase Analysis

**Objective:** This document will record observed system-level patterns, architectural decisions, and common design choices within the Hyperswitch codebase, primarily focusing on the `crates/` directory. It will be updated iteratively.

**Initial Hypotheses (to be validated and expanded):**

1.  **Modular Design (Crates):**
    *   The project is divided into multiple Rust crates, each likely responsible for a specific domain or functionality (e.g., `api_models`, `router`, `connector_configs`, `common_enums`).
    *   Clear separation of concerns between crates is expected.
    *   `lib.rs` or `main.rs` will serve as entry points for each crate.
    *   Public APIs of crates will be explicitly defined.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Consistent use of Rust's `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations.
    *   Custom error enums/structs defined within crates or in a common error handling crate.
    *   Use of `?` operator for error propagation.
    *   Potentially a centralized error reporting/logging mechanism.

3.  **Asynchronous Operations:**
    *   Given the nature of a payment switch (network I/O), extensive use of `async/await` and a runtime like `tokio` is anticipated.
    *   Patterns for managing asynchronous tasks, futures, and streams.

4.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Configuration files (e.g., TOML, YAML, JSON) likely used to manage settings for different environments (development, production, testing).
    *   Crates for loading and parsing configuration (e.g., `config` crate).
    *   Structs for representing typed configuration.

5.  **State Management:**
    *   For a stateful application like a router, there will be mechanisms for managing application state. This could involve in-memory structures, a database, or a distributed cache (like Redis, as hinted by `config/redis.conf`).
    *   Patterns for accessing and modifying shared state safely (e.g., `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, message passing).

6.  **Connector Architecture (Key Area):**
    *   A core concept will be the abstraction for payment connectors.
    *   Traits defining common connector interfaces (e.g., for authorize, capture, refund).
    *   Specific implementations for different payment gateways/processors.
    *   Mechanisms for dynamically loading or selecting connectors.
    *   Transformer patterns for converting between Hyperswitch's internal models and connector-specific request/response formats.

7.  **Data Modeling & Persistence:**
    *   Structs representing core domain entities (payments, customers, mandates, etc.).
    *   Use of an ORM (like `diesel`, given `diesel.toml`) or direct database interaction for persistence.
    *   Database migrations (evident from the `migrations/` directory).

8.  **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests (`#[test]`) within modules.
    *   Integration tests (potentially in `tests/` directories or separate test crates like `test_utils`).
    *   Mocking strategies for external dependencies (especially payment connectors).

9.  **Logging & Tracing:**
    *   Use of logging frameworks (`log`, `tracing`) for diagnostics and monitoring.
    *   Structured logging for easier parsing and analysis.

**This document will evolve as the codebase is explored.**
