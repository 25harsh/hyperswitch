# Active Context: Hyperswitch Codebase Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-14

**1. Current Work Focus:**
*   **Completed SumUp Connector Integration (Backend & Config).**
*   Awaiting next task or further analysis based on project goals.

**2. Recent Changes (This Session):**
*   **SumUp Connector Implementation (Steps 1-19, 23-28 completed):**
    *   Generated template files using `sh scripts/add_connector.sh sumup https://api.sumup.com`.
    *   Relocated `test.rs` to `crates/router/tests/connectors/sumup.rs`.
    *   **Transformers (`sumup/transformers.rs`):**
        *   Defined request structs: `SumUpCardDetails`, `SumUpCheckoutRequest`, `SumUpProcessCheckoutRequest`, `SumUpRefundRequest`.
        *   Updated `SumupRouterData` to use `f64` for amount and `&'a T` for router data.
        *   Implemented `TryFrom` for all request structs, handling amount conversion to base units.
        *   Defined response structs: `SumUpTransactionData`, `SumUpResponseCardDetails`, `SumUpTransactionEvent`, `SumUpNextStep`, `SumUp3dsRedirectResponse`, `SumUpCheckoutResponse`. `SumUpProcessCheckoutResponse` aliased to `SumUpTransactionData`.
        *   Defined `SumUpPaymentStatus` enum with `UPPERCASE` serde rename and mapping to `common_enums::AttemptStatus` and `common_enums::RefundStatus`.
        *   Implemented `TryFrom` for `SumUpTransactionData` to `RouterData<...PaymentsAuthorizeData...>` (for Authorize success & PSync).
        *   Implemented `TryFrom` for `SumUp3dsRedirectResponse` to `RouterData<...PaymentsAuthorizeData...>`.
        *   Implemented `TryFrom` for `SumUpTransactionData` to `RouterData<...RefundsRouterData<RSync>...>`.
        *   Ensured `SumupAuthType` (with `api_key` and `merchant_code`) and `SumupErrorResponse` are defined.
    *   **Core Logic (`connectors/sumup.rs`):**
        *   Defined `pub struct Sumup;` with `#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone)]`.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorCommon`: `id`, `get_currency_unit` (Base), `common_get_content_type`, `base_url` (hardcoded to "https://api.sumup.com"), `get_auth_header` (Bearer token), `build_error_response`.
        *   Refactored `ConnectorIntegration<Authorize, ...>`:
            *   `get_url` -> `POST /v0.1/checkouts`.
            *   `get_request_body` -> `SumUpCheckoutRequest`.
            *   `build_request` -> `POST` request.
            *   `handle_response` -> Parses `SumUpCheckoutResponse`, stores `checkout_id` in `connector_metadata`, sets status to `RequiresCustomerAction`.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegration<Capture, ...>`: GET to `/v0.1/me/transactions/{id}`.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegration<PSync, ...>`: GET to `/v0.1/me/transactions/{id}`.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegration<Execute, RefundsData, ...>`: POST to `/v0.1/me/refund/{txn_id}`, handles 204 No Content.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegration<RSync, RefundsData, ...>`: GET to `/v0.1/me/transactions/{refund_txn_id}`.
        *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegration<Void, PaymentsCancelData, ...>`: DELETE to `/v0.1/checkouts/{checkout_id}`, handles 204 No Content.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   `config/development.toml`: Added `sumup` to `[[connectors.supported]].cards` and `[connectors.sumup]` section with `base_url`.
        *   `crates/router/tests/connectors/sample_auth.toml`: Added `[sumup]` section for API key.
        *   `crates/hyperswitch_domain_models/src/configs.rs`: Added `pub sumup: ConnectorParams,` to `Connectors` struct.
    *   **Testing (`crates/router/tests/connectors/sumup.rs`):**
        *   Populated `get_default_payment_info()` and `payment_method_details()`.
        *   Implemented `should_initiate_authorize_payment()` for the first auth step.
        *   Implemented `should_get_auto_captured_payment_status()` for Capture flow.
        *   Implemented `should_sync_payment_status()` for PSync flow.
        *   Implemented `should_create_refund()` for Refund Execute flow.
        *   Implemented `should_sync_refund_status()` for Refund Sync flow.
        *   Implemented `should_void_checkout()` for Void flow.
*   **Skipped UI Steps:** Steps 20-22 for Control Center UI were skipped per user instruction.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md`.

**3. Next Steps:**
*   Await new task or further instructions for analysis.
*   If continuing general codebase analysis:
    *   Optionally, look into `crates/common_utils` for shared helper functions.
    *   Select 1-2 more connectors (e.g., Paypal, Adyen) for a high-level comparison.

**4. Active Decisions and Considerations:**
*   **SumUp Authorize Flow:** Implemented as a two-step process. The `Authorize` trait handles the first step (checkout creation). The second step (PUT with payment details) is assumed to be handled by a subsequent Hyperswitch flow (e.g., a redirect or a payment confirmation step using the `checkout_id` stored in `connector_metadata`).
*   **SumUp Capture Flow:** Implemented as a GET status check, assuming auto-capture.
*   **SumUp Void Flow:** Implemented as `DELETE /v0.1/checkouts/{checkout_id}` for pre-payment cancellation.
*   **Merchant Code for SumUp:** Currently sourced via `SumupAuthType` which might need refinement based on how it's provided in production (e.g., from `MerchantConnectorAccount`). Test files and `SumUpCheckoutRequest` transformer reflect this.

**5. Important Patterns and Preferences (Reinforced/Observed during SumUp integration):**
*   Connector-specific request/response structs are crucial for type safety and clarity.
*   `TryFrom` traits are standard for converting between Hyperswitch and connector types.
*   Amount conversions (e.g., minor to base units) are handled during transformation.
*   `ConnectorCommon` provides foundational details.
*   Each payment flow (`Authorize`, `Capture`, `PSync`, `RefundExecute`, `RSync`, `Void`) has a dedicated `ConnectorIntegration` implementation.
*   Test helpers (`get_default_payment_info`, `payment_method_details`) and specific test functions for each flow are standard.
*   Configuration involves `development.toml` (or environment-specific), `sample_auth.toml`, and domain model config structs.

**6. Learnings and Project Insights (This Session - SumUp Specific):**
*   SumUp's two-step authorization requires careful consideration of how it maps to Hyperswitch flows. The current approach models the first step in `Authorize` and assumes the second step is handled subsequently.
*   API documentation is key for details like endpoint paths (e.g., `/v0.1/me/transactions/` vs `/v2.1/merchants/.../transactions`), expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 204 for successful refunds/voids), and request/response payloads.
*   The `make_payment` test utility is useful for simulating end-to-end successful payments for subsequent tests like PSync, Capture, and Refund.
