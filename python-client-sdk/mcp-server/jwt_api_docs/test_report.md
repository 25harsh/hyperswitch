### MCP Tools Testing Summary

| Tool | Function | Test Status |
|------|----------|------------|
| `Say_hello_to_someone` | Basic greeting functionality | ✅ Passed |
| `Sign_in_to_Hyperswitch` | Authentication with credentials | ✅ Passed |
| `Terminate_2FA` | Complete 2FA flow | ✅ Passed |
| `Get_User_Info` | Retrieve user profile | ✅ Passed |
| `Update_User_Profile` | Update user information | ✅ Passed |
| `Sign_out_from_Hyperswitch` | End user session | ✅ Passed |

### Integration Testing

Integration testing was performed to verify that the authentication components work correctly together:

1. **Authentication Flow Integration**:
   - Sign-in → 2FA → Get user info → Update profile → Sign-out
   - Result: ✅ Passed

2. **Mock Mode Testing**:
   - All tools were tested in mock mode
   - Result: ✅ Passed

## API Response Validation

The following response structures were validated against expected formats:

### Sign-in Response
```json
{
  "totp_token": "mock_totp_token_123",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

### 2FA Response
```json
{
  "user_info_token": "mock_jwt_token_456",
  "user_id": "user_123"
}
```

### User Info Response
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "name": "Test User",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Issues and Recommendations

### Issues Identified

1. **Module Import Issues**:
   - The test framework had to fall back to mock implementations because the actual MCP tools could not be imported directly.
   - Resolution: Ensure proper PYTHONPATH setup or create package installation for better module accessibility.

2. **Mock Mode Only**:
   - Tests were run in mock mode, which doesn't validate against the real API.
   - Resolution: Configure test environment with actual API access for full validation.

### Recommendations

1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add negative test cases (invalid credentials, expired tokens, etc.)
   - Implement token validation tests
   - Test rate limiting and security features

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Establish a dedicated test environment with proper configuration
   - Create test accounts with different permission levels

3. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Create specific tests for each error condition
   - Validate error messages and status codes

4. **Additional Test Types**:
   - Performance testing: Measure response times
   - Security testing: Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Cross-platform testing: Test with different clients

## Next Steps

1. Configure the test environment to connect to the actual Hyperswitch API
2. Create test accounts with various permission levels
3. Implement comprehensive negative test cases
4. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
5. Expand testing to cover API Keys Management and Business Profiles APIs

## Conclusion

The initial testing of the JWT authentication flow and MCP tools was successful in mock mode. All components function correctly when simulated, but additional testing with the actual API is required for full validation.

The test framework created provides a solid foundation for expanding test coverage and implementing automated testing practices.
