# Hyperswitch JWT-Based API Implementation Approach

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to implementing JWT-based API integrations for the Hyperswitch MCP SDK. The implementation is structured around logical API groups, each with its own implementation plan, execution log, and troubleshooting guide.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Group-Based Implementation

We've organized the Hyperswitch JWT-based APIs into logical groups:

1. **User Authentication & Management** - Core authentication and user operations
2. **Business Profiles** - CRUD operations for merchant business profiles
3. **API Keys Management** - Create, list, and manage API keys
4. **Merchant Management** - Merchant account operations
5. **Roles & Permissions** - User role and permissions management
6. **Payments & Refunds Reporting** - Payment and refund reporting endpoints
7. **Disputes Management** - Dispute handling and resolution endpoints

Each group is implemented as a logical unit with shared authentication and data models.

### 2. Authentication Flow

All JWT-based APIs follow a common authentication flow:

1. **Sign In** - Authenticate with email/password and receive a TOTP token
2. **Terminate 2FA** - Exchange the TOTP token for a user info JWT token
3. **Use JWT Token** - Include the JWT token in subsequent requests as Bearer token

Some APIs may require additional authentication such as API keys alongside the JWT token.

### 3. Modular Structure

We follow a modular approach to implementation:

- **Core Modules**:
  - `auth.py` - Authentication functions and JWT handling
  - `utils.py` - Shared utilities, logging, and debugging tools
  
- **Feature Modules** (one per API group):
  - `user.py` - User management functions
  - `profiles.py` - Business profile functions
  - `api_keys.py` - API key management
  - etc.

- **MCP Tools**:
  - Each API endpoint is exposed as an MCP tool for interactive use
  - Follows a consistent naming convention (e.g., `List_Business_Profiles`)

### 4. Development Workflow

For each API group, we follow this development workflow:

1. **Plan**: Create detailed implementation plan in `plan.md`
2. **Implement Core Functions**: Develop core API functions in appropriate module
3. **Create MCP Tools**: Expose functions as MCP tools
4. **Test**: Verify correct functionality with unit and integration tests
5. **Document**: Update execution log and troubleshooting guide
6. **Review**: Perform code review and security checks
7. **Refine**: Address any issues and optimize implementation

## Documentation Structure

For each API group, we maintain three key documents:

1. **`plan.md`**: Implementation plan and technical design
   - APIs in the group
   - Implementation steps
   - Dependencies
   - Technical design
   - Testing approach
   - Security considerations
   - Deliverables

2. **`execution.md`**: Execution log tracking implementation progress
   - Implementation status for each API
   - Detailed implementation notes
   - Testing results
   - Next steps

3. **`troubleshooting.md`**: Guide for resolving common issues
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Debugging techniques
   - Error code reference
   - Recovery procedures

## Security Considerations

We prioritize security in our JWT API implementation:

1. **Token Security**:
   - Proper validation of JWT tokens
   - Secure token storage
   - Token expiration handling
   - Prevention of token leakage in logs

2. **Authentication**:
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Secure password handling
   - Rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Token revocation capability

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Masking of sensitive data in logs
   - Input validation to prevent injection attacks
   - Properly scoped permissions

## Testing Approach

Our comprehensive testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual API functions
2. **Integration Tests** - Test complete API workflows
3. **Authentication Tests** - Verify token handling and auth flows
4. **Error Handling Tests** - Confirm proper error responses
5. **Edge Case Tests** - Test unusual input and boundary conditions

## Implementation Status

Current implementation status:

- **Group 1: User Authentication & Management**
  - Sign In ‚úÖ
  - Terminate 2FA ‚úÖ
  - Other endpoints üìù

- **Group 2: Business Profiles**
  - List Profiles ‚úÖ
  - Other endpoints üìù

- **Remaining Groups**
  - All endpoints üìù

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of Group 1 (User Authentication)
2. Complete implementation of Group 2 (Business Profiles)
3. Proceed with implementation of remaining groups
4. Create comprehensive testing suite
5. Publish documentation and usage examples
